                <p class="bnr-para">
				Many professionals can agree that technology has grown and continues to become
				an important part of everyday life as it keeps evolving. Although students and
				professionals are very dependent on technology it is not always readily available.
				Many communities still lack adequate technical knowledge and equipment.
				This gap between underprivileged low-income communities with little to no access to
				technology and privileged wealthy and middle-class families with access is known as
				the Digital Divide. Electronics accessibility, service availability and proper technology
				information can contribute to reducing the digital divide gap that still exists today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In many lower-income communities, there are hard-working families doing their best to
				provide their children with the electronic devices they need for education, but it can
				be extremely difficult, especially if it’s a big family. Families in these situations
				need to prioritize how to spend their money. In many situations, the higher costs of
				living and low-income salaries continue to increase the gap of the digital divide.
				Underprivileged communities look for sources of support that can provide them with
				access to technology by going to libraries and other places that would allow them
				to get free access to both technology and the internet. Even when there are many
				institutions that work hard to continue providing access to the community, there is
				still more that can be done. iDonify plans to combat the digital divide by providing
				low or no cost electronic devices to low-income families. Many individuals have devices
				just sitting at home that are no longer being used. They either don’t know what to do with
				them or don’t know how they can recycle them. This system would give people an easy way
				to become a donor or even find a way to volunteer if they wished to do so.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The goal of this project is to create a website that a nonprofit organization can use
				to accept donations of electronic devices and offer repair services. It would include
				an administrative panel for administrators to manage donations and user data. This allows
				the organization to keep track of all records. A key part of donations is knowing exactly
				who is donating and how are those donations distributed. Being able to have a better and
				clear perspective of important details can help the organization focus on growing the number
				of donations to bridge the digital divide gap.
